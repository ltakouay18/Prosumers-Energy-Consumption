# Prosumers-Energy-Consumption

Kaggle competitions offer a vast array of datasets to develop machine learning models that tackle real world problems. This project is inspired by the Enefit -Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers competition, led by the company Enefit. Enefit is one of the largest energy companies in the European Baltic region and their mission is to help customers develop sustainable energy habits. The competition's goal is to tackle the issue of energy imbalance and reduce energy costs. Enefit offers solar panels for installation and production of energy at home, which results in customers being both producers and consumers of the energy, however it is essential to efficiently predict the amount of energy output to prevent electric grid operational issues and higher costs.

Machine Learning Models can enable to gather insights about the energy usage habits of prosumers in the region and effectively predict the amount of energy produced. Unsupervised Models such as clustering can enable to segment prosumers into different categories to understand energy consumption and generation behavior patterns. Supervised Machine Learning Models for Regression can predict the amount of energy generated based on various factors including solar panel product time, whether the prosumer is a business, gas prices and electricity prices fluctuations.
